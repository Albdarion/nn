# Neural Networks

This repo is dedicated to a studies' project where we explore how neural networks works

## Contents

- `data/`: folder you'll find source data files used for training and testing.
- `notebooks/`: folder you'll find source code files where different neural networks are implemented.
    - `NN1.ipynb`: notebook that contains the simplest neural network, weights and biases are set manually, regression example
    - `NN2.ipynb`: notebook with neural network that implements backpropagation, regression example
    - `NN3.ipynb`: notebook with adjusted backpropagation via momentum or RMSProp, regression example
    - `NN4.ipynb`: notebook with classification example
